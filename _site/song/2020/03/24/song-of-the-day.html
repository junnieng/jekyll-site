        <h1>Song of the day</h1>
    <p>March 24, 2020</p>
    <p>Looking for a song when you’re having a bad day ? This song is definitely the right one to cheer you up!</p>

<h1 id="bad-day">Bad day</h1>

<h4 id="by-daniel-powter"><em>by Daniel Powter</em></h4>

<p>Where is the moment when we needed the most?</p>

<p>You kick up the leaves, and the magic is lost</p>

<p>They tell me your blue sky’s faded to gray</p>

<p>They tell me your passion’s gone away</p>

<p>And I don’t need no carrying on</p>

<p>Stand in the line just to hit a new low</p>

<p>You’re faking a smile with the coffee to go</p>

<p>You tell me your life’s been way off line</p>

<p>You’re falling to pieces every time</p>

<p>And I don’t need no carrying on</p>

<p>‘Cause you had a bad day</p>

<p>You’re taking one down</p>

<p>You sing a sad song just to turn it around</p>

<p>You say you don’t know</p>

<p>You tell me don’t lie</p>

<p>You work at a smile, and you go for a ride</p>

<p>You had a bad day</p>

<p>The camera don’t lie</p>

<p>You’re coming back down, and you really don’t mind</p>

<p>You had a bad day</p>

<p>You had a bad day</p>

<p>Well you need a blue sky holiday</p>

<p>The point is they laugh at what you say</p>

<p>And I don’t need no carrying on</p>

<p>You had a bad day</p>

<p>You’re taking one down</p>

<p>You sing a sad song just to turn it around</p>

<p>You say you don’t know</p>

<p>You tell me don’t lie</p>

<p>You work at a smile, and you go for a ride</p>

<p>You had a bad day</p>

<p>The camera don’t lie</p>

<p>You’re coming back down and you really don’t mind</p>

<p>You had a bad day</p>

<p>Sometimes the system goes on the blink, and the whole thing it turns out
Wrong</p>

<p>You might not make it back and you know that you could be well, oh, that
Strong</p>

<p>And I’m not wrong</p>

<p>So where is the passion when you need it the most?</p>

<p>Oh, you and I</p>

<p>You kick up the leaves and the magic is lost</p>

<p>‘Cause you had a bad day</p>

<p>You’re taking one down</p>

<p>You sing a sad song just to turn it around</p>

<p>You say you don’t know</p>

<p>You tell me don’t lie</p>

<p>You work at a smile and you go for a ride</p>

<p>You had a bad day</p>

<p>You see what you like</p>

<p>And how does it feel one more time?</p>

<p>You had a bad day</p>

<p>You had a bad day (had a bad day, had a bad day, had a bad day)</p>

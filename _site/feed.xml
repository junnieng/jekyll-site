&lt;p&gt;Canadians should continue to think ahead about the actions that they can take to stay healthy and prevent the spread of COVID-19 in Canada, including:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;_ Being prepared in case you or a family member become ill&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;_ Following the latest travel advice from federal and provincial public health leaders:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;_ Avoiding all non-essential travel, including cruise ships&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;_ Self-isolating, and monitoring for symptoms (cough, fever or difficulty breathing) for 14 days if you have travelled outside of Canada&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;_ Reducing contact with others by following the guidance for self-monitoring, self-isolating, or isolating&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;_ Practicing social distancing and proper hygiene&lt;/p&gt;

This is the post that you do not want to miss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;1-focus-on-commitment-not-motivation&quot;&gt;1. Focus on commitment, not motivation.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just how committed are you to your goal? How important is it for you, and what are you willing to sacrifice in order to achieve it? If you find yourself fully committed, motivation will follow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;2-seek-knowledge-not-results&quot;&gt;2. Seek knowledge, not results.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you focus on the excitement of discovery, improving, exploring and experimenting, your motivation will always be fueled. If you focus only on results, your motivation will be like weather—it will die the minute you hit a storm. So the key is to focus on the journey, not the destination. Keep thinking about what you are learning along the way and what you can improve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;3-make-the-journey-fun&quot;&gt;3. Make the journey fun.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s an awesome game! The minute you make it serious, there’s a big chance it will start carrying a heavy emotional weight and you will lose perspective and become stuck again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;4-get-rid-of-stagnating-thoughts&quot;&gt;4. Get rid of stagnating thoughts.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thoughts influence feelings and feelings determine how you view your work. You have a lot of thoughts in your head, and you always have a choice of which ones to focus on: the ones that will make you emotionally stuck (fears, doubts) or the ones that will move you forward (excitement, experimenting, trying new things, stepping out of your comfort zone).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;5-use-your-imagination&quot;&gt;5. Use your imagination.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next step after getting rid of negative thoughts is to use your imagination. When things go well, you are full of positive energy, and when you are experiencing difficulties, you need to be even more energetic. So rename your situation. If you keep repeating I hate my work, guess which feelings those words will evoke? It’s a matter of imagination! You can always find something to learn even from the worst boss in the world at the most boring job. I have a great exercise for you: Just for three days, think and say positive things only. See what happens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;6-stop-being-nice-to-yourself&quot;&gt;6. Stop being nice to yourself.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Motivation means action and action brings results. Sometimes your actions fail to bring the results you want. So you prefer to be nice to yourself and not put yourself in a difficult situation. You wait for the perfect timing, for an opportunity, while you drive yourself into stagnation and sometimes even into depression. Get out there, challenge yourself, do something that you want to do even if you are afraid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;7-get-rid-of-distractions&quot;&gt;7. Get rid of distractions.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meaningless things and distractions will always be in your way, especially those easy, usual things you would rather do instead of focusing on new challenging and meaningful projects. Learn to focus on what is the most important. Write a list of time-wasters and hold yourself accountable to not do them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;8-dont-rely-on-others&quot;&gt;8. Don’t rely on others.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should never expect others to do it for you, not even your partner, friend or boss. They are all busy with their own needs. No one will make you happy or achieve your goals for you. It’s all on you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;9-plan&quot;&gt;9. Plan.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Know your three steps forward. You do not need more. Fill out your weekly calendar, noting when you will do what and how. When-what-how is important to schedule. Review how each day went by what you learned and revise what you could improve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;10-protect-yourself-from-burnout&quot;&gt;10. Protect yourself from burnout.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s easy to burn out when you are very motivated. Observe yourself to recognize any signs of tiredness and take time to rest. Your body and mind rest when you schedule relaxation and fun time into your weekly calendar. Do diverse tasks, keep switching between something creative and logical, something physical and still, working alone and with a team. Switch locations. Meditate, or just take deep breaths, close your eyes, or focus on one thing for five minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You lack motivation not because you are lazy or don’t have a goal. Even the biggest stars, richest businesspeople or the most accomplished athletes get lost sometimes. What makes them motivated is the curiosity about how much better or faster they can get. So above all, be curious, and this will lead you to your goals and success.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Want to know how people can success ?

&lt;h2 id=&quot;1-stick-to-a-solid-sleeping-schedule&quot;&gt;1. Stick to a solid sleeping schedule&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Better sleeping habits have more benefits than you think.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t underestimate the importance of getting a good night’s rest. Sleep is when your body recovers — whether it’s from exercise, stress, or something else entirely. Getting a solid amount of sleep every night has been linked to higher productivity, increased ability in the gym, and higher levels of mental activity. In short, sleep is important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;2-follow-an-easy-morning-routine&quot;&gt;2. Follow an easy morning routine&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your morning routine can have a huge impact on your health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The morning — or whenever you wake up — may be the most important part of your day. That’s why you need to develop a routine, keep it, and use it as a springboard to set you off for another round of victories, says Mark’s Daily Apple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A morning routine can be simple — shower, eat a healthy breakfast, make your bed, and you’re off. Maybe mix in some meditation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;3-drop-the-sugar&quot;&gt;3. Drop the sugar&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cutting out sugar will change your life for good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sugar is linked to all kinds of negative outcomes. Your best bet is to kick the habit now and never look back. Start drinking your coffee black, your tea without any sweetener, and opt for a piece of fruit instead of having a bowl of ice cream or reaching for a Snickers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;4-concentrate-on-your-diet&quot;&gt;4. Concentrate on your diet&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A healthy diet is key to lifelong fitness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of us struggle to control our diet, but one easy way to do so is to concentrate on the things we eat. That is, centralize your diet around a select group of foods, and only occasionally stray from your plan. U.S. News &amp;amp; World Report suggests constructing a diet that’s vegetable-based — not necessarily vegetarian or vegan, but heavy on the greens — and not so dependent on meats, breads, and fats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;5-cook-more-often&quot;&gt;5. Cook more often&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cooking is one of many healthy habits everyone should adopt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ever wonder why it’s so hard to stick to a diet when you’re eating out or relying on packaged foods to get you through the day? It’s because you aren’t in control of what goes into your food. The best way to combat this healthy eating barrier is to prepare as many of your own meals as possible. According to the journal Public Health Nutrition, eating more home-cooked meals increases your likelihood of a higher-quality diet. You might even lose weight. The only “additives” in meals you prepare are the ones you add yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;6-find-ways-to-relieve-stress&quot;&gt;6. Find ways to relieve stress&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Relieve stress to live a healthier life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’re going to need to find a way to decompress, or blow off some steam. Some like to go to the shooting range or play pickup basketball or soccer. A great habit to get into is weight lifting or running to relieve stress. Other fantastic, stress-relieving habits to pick up are meditation and yoga.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;7-sit-less-move-more&quot;&gt;7. Sit less, move more&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moving around throughout the day is good for your health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your job involves sitting for 90% of your workday, you could be damaging your health without even knowing it. According to Mayo Clinic, sitting too much increases your risk for a number of conditions, especially heart disease. Even if you exercise for 30 minutes every day, spending the next eight hours or more just sitting at a desk mean those 30 minutes of fitness almost don’t count.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ideally, you should get up and walk a few hundred steps at least every hour (it only takes a few minutes!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;8-drink-more-water&quot;&gt;8. Drink more water&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dehydration can cause headaches and fatigue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not drinking enough water can lead to mental and physical fatigue. Research also suggests drinking more water throughout the day can help you lose weight. Many people often confuse hunger and thirst, and end up eating more than they need to because they reach for food instead of a glass of water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;9-spend-time-outdoors&quot;&gt;9. Spend time outdoors&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spending time outdoors is good for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Going outside is better for your overall health than you thought. Rodale’s Organic Life notes spending time outdoors can help improve your concentration, reduce stress and anxiety, and increase your vitamin D intake. A little fresh air, even for 15 minutes, can have a huge impact on your mood and pull you away from the stress and noise of the cramped indoors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;10-learn-to-love-exercise&quot;&gt;10. Learn to love exercise&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make exercise a habit for lifelong fitness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, you’ll need to exercise. And learn to love it. You may be a runner, lifter, swimmer, or hiker. Regardless, it’s important to develop a love for physical activity, and to make it a mainstay in your life in some form or another. No matter what it is, you’ll want to get “addicted” to some kind of physical activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the long run, you’ll set yourself up for success. Just teach yourself to view exercise and the rest of these habits as simple parts of your day; something you enjoy rather than a chore to be completed.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Go gain or go home !</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Song of the day</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/song/2020/03/24/song-of-the-day.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Song of the day" /><published>2020-03-24T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2020-03-24T00:00:00-06:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/song/2020/03/24/song-of-the-day</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/song/2020/03/24/song-of-the-day.html">&lt;p&gt;Looking for a song when you’re having a bad day ?

&lt;p&gt;Where is the moment when we needed the most?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You kick up the leaves, and the magic is lost&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They tell me your blue sky’s faded to gray&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They tell me your passion’s gone away&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I don’t need no carrying on&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stand in the line just to hit a new low&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’re faking a smile with the coffee to go&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You tell me your life’s been way off line&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’re falling to pieces every time&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I don’t need no carrying on&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘Cause you had a bad day&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’re taking one down&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You sing a sad song just to turn it around&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You say you don’t know&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You tell me don’t lie&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You work at a smile, and you go for a ride&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You had a bad day&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The camera don’t lie&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’re coming back down, and you really don’t mind&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You had a bad day&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You had a bad day&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well you need a blue sky holiday&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The point is they laugh at what you say&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I don’t need no carrying on&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You had a bad day&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’re taking one down&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You sing a sad song just to turn it around&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You say you don’t know&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You tell me don’t lie&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You work at a smile, and you go for a ride&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You had a bad day&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The camera don’t lie&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’re coming back down and you really don’t mind&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You had a bad day&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes the system goes on the blink, and the whole thing it turns out
Wrong&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might not make it back and you know that you could be well, oh, that
Strong&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I’m not wrong&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So where is the passion when you need it the most?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, you and I&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You kick up the leaves and the magic is lost&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘Cause you had a bad day&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’re taking one down&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You sing a sad song just to turn it around&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You say you don’t know&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You tell me don’t lie&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You work at a smile and you go for a ride&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You had a bad day&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You see what you like&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And how does it feel one more time?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You had a bad day&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You had a bad day (had a bad day, had a bad day, had a bad day)&lt;/p&gt;
